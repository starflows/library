# This flow script is called by the loop_parent.py flow script. It executes a
# number of REST calls to the geonames API. You cannot execute this flow script
# as it is on its own, as it requires inputs that are passed on from the parent
# flow.
# In this example, we are interested in the coordinates of each country's
# capital city.
# Due to the structure of the API calls available in the geonames API, we
# have several steps to complete: starting with the country name (which is
# our input), we need to get the country code, then the capital's name, and
# then the capital's coordinates.
# Here, we can begin to see why looping is useful: even for fairly simple
# REST calls, it is often necessary to chain together several calls to get
# the information you need, so writing a loop can save a lot of lines in your
# script - and parallelising the calls can save you a lot of time.
# Note that after the first API call, we add a check if there was a valid
# result and set the result to a warning if there isn't. This is to make
# sure that the loop runs through all input values even if there are invalid
# values in the input list.
# Exception handling depends on the API: the geonames API simply returns an
# empty object for invalid search queries like the ones we are executing,
# with a success status code. For other errors in the call (e.g. missing
# parameters) it would return a status code that you could use to catch
# exceptions. In our case, we assume that we need to ensure that errors in
# the input list don't trip up the loop, but assume that other parameters
# are correct, such as the username and the call syntax. Assuming that this
# runs automatically, the input list is the only thing that will change from
# run to run so it is the most likely source of errors.

# object (system) and an Execution object of this execution (this)

# (3) get inputs from parent execution

    # The parent execution passed inputs to this execution, therefore we
    # don't need to specify an execution ID from which to get the inputs.
    # c.get_inputs() will capture the inputs given by the parent execution.
