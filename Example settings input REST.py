# This flow script shows how the REST and INPUT tasks can be used together, by
# requesting parameters for a REST API call from a user.
# In this small example, a user is asked for a country name. The flow script
# then queries the REST API of the geonames service, which provides information
# about countries. The information about the country is then returned to the
# user, and the user is asked if they liked the information. Their response is
# captured in the end message of the flow script.

# This flow script call the geonames REST API to get information about a
# country. In order to use the geonames REST API, it is necessary to create a
# geonames account and enable it for the use of their webservices. They are
# free, but there are usage limits (very generous ones). If you are interested
# in using the geonames web services, you can register here:
# http://www.geonames.org/login and use your own account to execute this flow
# script. If not, we will use the demo user name provided by geonames for demo
# purposes only. Since this demo account also has usage limits, there is a
# chance that the flow script will fail due to these limits.

import flow_api

# (1) define handler function for the Cloudomation class (c)
def handler(system: flow_api.System, this: flow_api.Execution):

# (2) use settings
    # To use the geonames REST API, it is required to register an application,
    # which is identified via a user name that has to be provided with every
    # REST call. The best way to manage parameters like this is to store them
    # as Cloudomation settings. In this way, usernames can be changed easily in
    # the settings view without having to edit the flow scripts which use it.
    # For this example flow script, we will first check if the setting exists
    # and if it doesn't, we will create it and fill it with a demo user name.
    # This is not recommended best practice - the user name should not be hard
    # coded into the flow script. Another option would be to check if the
    # setting exists and if not, as the user to input a user name. However for
    # the purposes of this example flow script, we will create a setting that
    # contains the user name to demonstate how to use settings.
    # NOTE that settings are not intended for passwords or other sensible
    # information. For passwords, we recommend the use of Hashicorp Vault.

    # we check if there is a setting with the key geonames_username
    geonames_username = system.setting('geonames_username')
    if not geonames_username.exists():
        # if the setting doesn't exist, we set it to the demo user name.
        # if it does exist, this line will be skipped.
        geonames_username.save(value='demo')

    # then we read out the value of the geonames_username setting
    # note that this is not related to the previous check. We need to read
    # the setting in any case, independent of whether it was set by the script,
    # or before the script was run
    username = geonames_username.get('value')

    # (3) use INPUT task

    # We want to provide the user with information about a country. We ask for
    # a country and explain what we are planning to do.
    countryname_request = this.task(
        'INPUT',
        # the INPUT function has one required parameter: the request. This is
        # what users will see and respond to.
        request=(
            'This is a country information service. If you input a country '
            'name, I will tell you a few things about this country. Please '
            'only type one country at a time. Which country would you like '
            'to learn about?'
        )
    )
    # now, the variable countryname_request contains the *execution object*
    # of the input task. From the execution object, we can get e.g. its ID,
    # its status, its runtime etc. - and most importantly, its outputs.
    # What kind of outputs you can get from an execution object depends on
    # the execution, i.e. which task you ran.

    # we get the outputs and store them in a variable 'countryname_results'
    countryname_result = countryname_request.get('output_value')

    # because we want to learn about the INPUT task, we log all the outputs to
    # see what we get back. This is not required, we do this just for learning
    # purposes. Take a look at the log to see what the INPUT task returns.
    this.log('Outputs of the INPUT task:', countryname_result)

    # It returns a JSON element and we can access the individual elements with
    # standard Python syntax: we are only interested in the user's response,
    # which should be a country name. We store it in the variable 'countryname'.
    countryname = countryname_result['response']

    # (4) use REST task
    # Now, we want to get some information about the country. To request
    # information about a country, the geonames API requires the ISO-2 country
    # code of that country, so our first request will be to get the ISO-2
    # country code for the country name. This is also an opportunity for us to
    # see if the user input a valid country name - if they didn't, this request
    # will fail.

    # Here, we use the two previously defined paramenters: the username we read
    # from a setting, and the country name from the user input. Note that you
    # can use standard python string formatting functionality for defining the
    # URL with parameters.
    countrycode_request = this.task(
        'REST',
        url=(
            f'http://api.geonames.org/search?'
            f'name={countryname}&'
            f'featureCode=PCLI'
            f'&type=JSON'
            f'&username={username}'
        )
    )
    # again, we execute the REST task right away and store the resulting
    # execution object in a variable: countrycode_request

    # now we get the response returned from the REST call
    countrycode_response = countrycode_request.get('output_value')

    # First, we need to check if the REST call returned anything. If it didn't,
    # we will end the execution and inform the user. If it did, we continue.

    # because we want to learn about the REST task, we log the response
    # returned by the REST call. Take a look at the log to see what is returend
    # by the REST call. It is again a JSON whose elements we can access.
    this.log('Outputs of the country code REST task:', countrycode_response)

    # the geonames call returns the number of search results, which we access:
    response_count = countrycode_response['json']['totalResultsCount']

    # check if the REST call returned 0 results
    if response_count < 1:
        # if it is 0, we will end the execution and tell the user that we
        # coudn't find the country. If the REST call did return a result,
        # this line will be skipped and the script will continue.
        return this.error('We could not find the country you named.')

    # we access the country code. If you look at the response which we logged,
    # you will see that the JSON is nested so we need to go through a few
    # layers before we get to the country code.
    countrycode = countrycode_response['json']['geonames'][0]['countryCode']

    # (5) another REST task

    # now that we have the country code, we want to get some information
    # about the country
    countryinfo_request = this.task(
        'REST',
        url=(
            f'http://api.geonames.org/countryInfo?'
            f'country={countrycode}'
            f'&type=JSON'
            f'&username={username}'
        )
    )

    # we get the ouput from the execution object
    countryinfo_result = countryinfo_request.get('output_value')['json']['geonames'][0]

    # because we want to learn about the REST task, we log the response
    # returned by the REST call. Take a look at the log to see what is returend
    # by the REST call. It is again a JSON whose elements we can access.
    this.log('Outputs of the country information REST task:', countryinfo_result)

    # (6) give the user some information about the country and ask for  feedback

    # now that we already saw how the INPUT task works, we chain it all
    # together, directly getting the output and not storing the execution
    # object in a separate variable.
    user_feedback = this.task(
        'INPUT',
        request=(f'Here is some information about  {countryname}. It is '
                 f'located in {countryinfo_result["continentName"]}, '
                 f'its capital is {countryinfo_result["capital"]}, '
                 f'it has a population of {countryinfo_result["population"]}, '
                 f'and an area of {countryinfo_result["areaInSqKm"]} '
                 f'square kilometers. Did you like this information?')
        ).run(
    ).get('output_value')['response']

    # (7) end execution

    # we add the user feedback to the end message
    return this.success(
        message=(
            f'Country info provided. Did the user like the information? '
            f'{user_feedback}')
